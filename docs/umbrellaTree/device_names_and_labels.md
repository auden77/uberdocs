## naming devices
when naming devices a random word may be used. if a known quantity of devices is grouped together, you may want to use a phrase to group the devices together, such as:
```three blind mice```
## device labels
 storage devices should have the following label on their partitions:
 ```<device_name>.<generation>.<individual_name>```
 for example:
 ```bolt.finch.elbaite```
 the above example is not entirely accurate, because label names can only have a maximum of sixteen characters. the resulting label will be truncated to:
 ```bolt.finch.elba```
